Language Translator using TensorFlow
Welcome to the Language Translator using TensorFlow project! This robust tool uses TensorFlow to create a highly accurate and efficient language translation system. It is ideal for applications such as multilingual communication, content localization, and more. The project is designed to be user-friendly and highly customizable, featuring real-time text translation, a pre-trained model for immediate use, and the capability to train the model with your own dataset for supporting new languages or improving accuracy.

To get started, ensure you have Python 3.6+, TensorFlow 2.x, and other necessary libraries listed in requirements.txt. Clone the repository, create a virtual environment, and install the required dependencies. Configure the system by updating config.json with your model and dataset paths. You can run the language translator by initializing the LanguageTranslator class and calling the translate_text method. If you need to train the model, use the train_model.py script with your dataset to define the paths for training data and labels, and specify parameters such as epochs and batch size.
